# VillagerBreeding1.21
A minecraft datapack which allows villagers to breed while mobGriefing is set to TRUE without creepers, ghasts griefing your stuff.


Make sure your gamerule mobGriefing is set to TRUE. In 1.21 and older versions you can't make villagers pick up items or breed if your gamerule mobGriefing is set to True. This datapack solves that problem.

##Which version shall I use for this?
This version only works for 1.21+. I will release other versions if needed.

##Installation
1. Download the zip file and extract it into your datapacks folder
2. Reload your game and it shall work perfectly.
